    <h1>Welcome to myFlix API Documentation</h1>

    <p>
      The myFlix API provides users with access to information about different
      movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal
      information, and create a list of their favorite movies. This API is part
      of a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express,
      React, and Node.js) stack.
